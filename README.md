Welcome to Forest AI ! A vigilant system that detects and alerts illegal deforestation in realtime. A smart solar powered device is deployed under tree canopies listening for all sorts of sounds. As soon as sound of chainsaw is detected in forest, device picks it up and sends an alert through a standard cellphone network to the nearest forest-ranger & first responders so that they can intervene immediately and stop it.
